// b. Call the readInput() function and get the arrays filled. The list must be ordered by the course numbers. 
//    This is important for this grade level.
// c. Call the printList() function and print the course numbers and students neatly formatted.

}

// - This function prints a welcome message to the user.
void welcome() {

}


// a. This function takes an array of c-strings, and an array of ints and reads the
//    course numbers and students enrolled from the user.

// b. Read until the user enters “Quit” or “quit” for the course number. The
//    SampleA04.cpp should help you do this. Read the corresponding number of
//    students enrolled.

// c. Call the readInt function to read the number of students for each course
//    number. You must catch all invalid data such as characters, negative numbers
//    etc.

// d. You must also do validation to make sure that the number is between 0 and 25.
//    The maximum number of students that can be enrolled in a course is less than or
//    equal to 25. Use a while loop to do this.

// e. Insert the course number and the number of students in the right position based
//   on the course number. You must not use any sorting algorithm. Insert the
//   course numbers and its students in the right position, by finding the
//   position and shifting the other courses. Here is an example -
//   insertSorted.cpp. See sample run below.

// f. count will keep track of the number of courses entered.

// g. Test your function with at least 10 courses to make sure that the insertion works
//    correctly.
void readInput(char courseNums[][MAXCHAR + 1], int students[], int &count) {

}

// a. This function should be used any time you read any integers from the user. Use
//    this function to read the menu option from the user.
// b. It takes a string prompt, outputs it, reads a number from the user, validates and
//    returns the num by reference.
// c. See Samplea01.cpp for the function. You may use the function in the sample.
// d. You must catch all invalid data such as characters, negative numbers etc.
void readInt(string prompt, int &num) {

}

// a. This function takes the 2 arrays and count, uses a for loop and prints the lists to the user.
// b. Format your list neatly.
void printList(char courseNums[][MAXCHAR + 1], int students[], int count) {

}

// a. This function takes the 2 arrays and the count and removes all courses with less
//    than 10 students in the course.
// b. You must use a for loop, find the index where the number of students is less than 10, 
//    and then remove that number and the corresponding course number from the
//    char array by shifting elements in both the arrays.
// c. Update the count appropriately. If you cancel or remove 3 courses, then count
//    should be subtracted by 3, so the number of courses is updated.
void cancelCourses(char courseNums[][MAXCHAR + 1], int students[], int &count) {

}
